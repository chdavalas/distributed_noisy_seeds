# distributed_noisy_seeds
A map-reduce implementation of the NoisySeeds algorithm as described in the paper of kazemi et al. "Growing a graph from a handful of seeds". An addition to this implementation is an experimental seed generation algorithm for the purpose of solving the problem of finding side information.

The Distributed_Noisy_Seeds (DiNoiSe) algorithm follows the same logic as the original NoisySeeds algorithm
